# swift-tesseractocr-example

This is my first open source project. 
I do not create a new library or tool. 
I just make a project that will use tesseractocr to make ios recognize japanese word from ocr.
So you can just make use of this example project for any purpose. 
If you have any question please remind me. I will be happy to help.
